# belief_state
This module of [NaivPhys4RP](https://github.com/NaivPhys4RP/naivphys4rp/) is mainly responsible for hosting and enabling the interactions with the robot belief of the world state. An Imagination-Capable Belief State (ICBS) goes beyond usual semantic scene graphs (objects’ description and relations among objects) and incorporates the scene geometry (e.g., articulated 3D models), scene physics (e.g., gravity, friction, mass, forces, viscosity, waves), scene agents (e.g., operating robots’ motorics and sensorics), scene ontology (i.e., semantics). For a possibly lossless representation and reliable simulation of the belief, the latter is directly represented in a photo-realistic and physics-faithful game engine, grounded in a rich scene ontology, and interfaces are provided to assert, modify, simulate and query it.
